this mod replaces all paintings with your custom ones.<br>
- create or use a folder named "CustomPaintings" within the plugins or config folder(subfolders also work).<br>

- put any .png, .jpg, .jpeg file in this folder and play.<br>

there is a converter with instructions on the github page.<br>
enjoy!!<br>
<br>

- everyone needs to install the images
- for sync to work everyone needs the exact same images


this works with multiple different folders in different locations.<br>
as long as al the folders are named "CustomPaintings" and is within any (sub)folder within BepInEx\plugins.<br>
