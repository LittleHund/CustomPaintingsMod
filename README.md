# CustomPaintings
this mod replaces all paintings with your custom images.<br>

to use your images:<br>

- create or use a folder named "CustomPaintings" within the plugins or config folder(subfolders also work).<br>
<b>for sharing profile codes the config folder is recommended</b><br>

- put any .png, .jpg, .jpeg file in this folder and play.
- everyone needs to install the images.
- for sync to work everyone needs the exact same images in the same location with the same name.
- enjoy!!
<br>

this works with multiple different folders in different locations.<br>
there is a png and jpeg converter with instructions on the github page.<br>
the converter will also change the names to numbers.<br>
