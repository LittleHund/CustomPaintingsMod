	- go to https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/#release-builds
	- download ffmpeg-release-full.7z
	- extract the ffmpeg.exe file from the bin folder
	- put ffmpeg.exe in the same folder as the converter.bat

- create a folder called GifsToConvert in the converter folder

- done

images will automatically be moved to the CustomImages folder and renamed to numbers from 1 up
images in the ImagesToConvert folder will be deleted
